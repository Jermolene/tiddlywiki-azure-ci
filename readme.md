# TiddlyWiki on Azure with Continuous Integration

This repo demonstrates how to create a TiddlyWiki Node.js server that runs on Microsoft Azure with continuous integration. Continuous integration means that changes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger Microsoft Azure to rebuild the application with the latest source code.

# Setting up Microsoft Azure

1. Create a new Web App, selecting Node.js as the runtime stack
2. Select the GitHub repo containing the application as the deployment source, and let Azure set it up
